# NTUA-Parallel-Systems

In this project we had 5 different Labs. For each Lab we have:

- Lab1: Introduction to Parallelism in Shared Memory Architectures

- Lab2: Parallelization and Optimization of the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm in Shared Memory Architectures (using Openmp , TBBs)

- Lab3: Parallel Solution of Heat Equation in Distributed Memory Architectures (using MPI)

- Lab4: Parallel Programming in GPUs (using CUDA)

- Lab5: Synchronization Issues in Modern Multicore Systems
